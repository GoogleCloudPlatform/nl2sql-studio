## Warnings
- **SQL Accuracy** : The SQL generated by this tool may be inefficient, inaccurate or incomplete. Always review and test the generated code before using it. We also recommend setting up periodic audits of the generated results.

- **Data Sensitivity** : Exercise caution when using this tool with sensitive or personal data. This framework can send imformation (sample rows, schema, comments etc.) from the database to LLMs, Vector Databases, etc. as part of the SQL generation pipeline. Ensure this does not violate your privacy policies and regulations. The framework may return improperly constructed SQL queries that can be exploited to gain unauthorized access or cause damage to your database. Always sanitize input parameters and validate generated SQL against known vulnerabilities.

- **Security Risks** : Please follow the the principle of least privilege while using this framework. This framework does not handle auth and relies on you to correctly configure access control mechanisms for the environment the code will be running in, so please ensure sufficient access restrictions for the account used to run this framework to prevent unintedned operations, bills etc. This framework may also auto-execute generated SQL queries for validation purposes, please ensure this is always used with read-only permissions to avoid accidental modifications to the database.
